# 🎯 Project Objective

## Vibe Coding Colosseum

### Vision

Create a competitive coding arena where developers ("gladiators") compete in live 1-hour coding challenges, judged by public vote. Think "American Idol meets Hackathon" with a gladiator/colosseum aesthetic.

### Core Objectives

1. **Democratized Competition**
   - No judges panel - the crowd votes live
   - Any developer can participate regardless of background
   - Transparent voting system

2. **Engagement Platform**
   - Real-time voting during demos
   - Spectator participation
   - Community-driven content

3. **Revenue Model**
   - Entry fee per gladiator (CAD $100 default)
   - Prize pool distribution (60% winner, 40% house)
   - Sponsor integrations

4. **Brand Identity**
   - Gladiator/Colosseum theme throughout
   - "Vibe Coding" philosophy - AI-assisted, fast shipping
   - Dark, epic, slightly humorous tone

### Success Metrics

- Number of registered gladiators per drop
- Spectator engagement (votes cast)
- Email open rates
- Registration completion rate
- Sponsor inquiries

### Target Users

1. **Gladiators**: Developers who want to prove their skills
2. **Spectators**: Tech enthusiasts who want to watch and vote
3. **Sponsors**: Companies wanting exposure to developer audience
